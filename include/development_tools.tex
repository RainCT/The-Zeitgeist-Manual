\subsection{Why Python for Engine?}
GNOME Zeitgeist started from the Gimmie/Mayanna codebase that was written 
in python. The tradition continued. Although we had several thoughts to move 
to Mono, C and Vala it never happened for several reasons. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Mono would have created a big debate in the community since a lot of 
GNOME hackers dislike it, however at the very beginning all ZG developers were 
keen with mono, yet to ensure no political issues we decided to stay with python.
\item C was and still is an issue since, only a few or the core devs are familiar 
with C and we will lose momentum.
\item Vala would have made Zeitgeist more a GNOME project than a desktop project 
and there is not much gain now in moving to any other programing language since 
speed and memory consumption wont be affected heavily in comparison to the effort 
we will have to put in it. That time Vala wasn't an option either because it 
doesn't support some D-Bus features we needed.
\end{itemize}
